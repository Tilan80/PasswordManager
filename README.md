# PasswordManager

A password manager built with Go, MongoDB, and Wails (using Vue) for a school project. (Scroll down for installation guide)
The Password Manager project is a robust and secure application with a carefully crafted backend in the Go language. The backend features a MongoDB database interaction, strong cryptographic functions, and well-defined application logic. Each password is encrypted using the user's initial login password, adding an extra layer of security to reinforce the confidentiality of sensitive user data.
On the frontend, orchestrated with Vue.js and Vuetify, the application provides a seamless and intuitive user experience. It includes features such as login, secure password management, and a responsive dashboard. The harmonious integration of the backend and frontend makes Password Manager a user-friendly solution for secure password management.
